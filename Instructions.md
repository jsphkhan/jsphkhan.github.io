# Guideline to install Fincheck Avocado Demo App
###### ** This is a showcase app that was created using the Avocado SDK. It is not meant to replace the PFM Fincheck App.
###### ** AvocadoSDK was the first prize winner idea in GarageFest 2017

## Steps to install
##### 1. Download and install the app by opening [this link](https://rink.hockeyapp.net/apps/ab6dbf48a62346328a2faa76fab0bff7) from your mobile browser.

##### 2. Once installed you will see the app appearing in your iPhone list of apps. Tap on the app to launch it. App should appear with the name Fincheck and a wallet icon.

##### 3. When you launch the app for the very first time you will see a dialog box like shown below. Just tap/click Cancel and follow the steps below. *Why this dialog comes? - this is because we are installing the app from HockeyApp (is an internal Yodlee app distribution platform) and not from the official Apple App Store*
